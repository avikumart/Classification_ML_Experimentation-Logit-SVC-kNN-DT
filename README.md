# Classification_ML_Experimentation-Logit-SVC-kNN-DT

In this project, I have built four different classification models to see how algorithms perform and work under various hyper-parameters and with unbalanced data.

Pre-processing techniques used:

- MinMaxScaler

Machine learning algorithms used: 
1. Support Vector Machines
2. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier

Classification metrics:

1. `accuracy score`
2. `roc_auc_score`
